# Kavanet Controller

## Thoughts
### Heating operation
- No schedule
- Manual opens all valves
- Boost opens all valves and surns on heating and fan for a bit
- Radiator fan controls stay the same

## Screens
- Diagnostics screen
  - Shows all devices and their state
  - Might be worth making proper classes

Start from the heating on button in the interface and go from there
